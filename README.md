Part 1: Use OpenAI Realtime API to implement a seamless audio chat functionality on a web page. 
Users can press a button to start the chat and chat about any topic with Open AI's bot. User can ask the next question seamlessly without pressing any buttons

Bonus : Part 2: 
Get the bot to only respond to questions about Indian tourism. For all other questions, it could give out a generic message saying "I can not reply to this question"
